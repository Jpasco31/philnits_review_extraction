When the volume of data sent in a short period is large, congestion occurs due to the difference in server performance. In this case, which of the following buffer sizes cannot reduce congestion and improve throughput? Assume the sending task has a higher transfer speed than the transfer speed of the receiving task, and the data transfer speed is constant.",
